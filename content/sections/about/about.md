I'm a SysAdmin/Project Manager based in Romania working remotely around the globe. I love working technology and I've been doing that my whole life. I spend most of my time tinkering with my homelab, finding open source software as well as enjoy a good movie here and there. This very website is a result of me trying something new.

Currently pursuing a CyberSecurity career path, learning Python, Networking and playing with HackTheBox from time to time.
