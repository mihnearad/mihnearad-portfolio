## What is this? 

Welcome to my Gatsby website/portfolio! I've started with the idea of creating an online repository of ideas and projects. I wanted something more visual than Github as a starter page, hence Mihnea's Portal was born. I haven't done many changes to the template as it suited my needs as it was. 


## How can I make something similar? 

I used this [theme](https://gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal-theme.netlify.app/) and various Youtube tutorials to get it going and deployed on Digital Ocean. 

## What were the biggest challenges with this project? 

After installing the theme using gatsby-cli, I've only had issues when deploying to Digital Ocean as there was nowhere mentioned that you need to run `gitsby clean` before deploying as the `.cache` directory would cause issues.
